1. Introduction <a name="1"></a>
   * Quiz
     * 1. Question 1 of 7: What does it mean when we say JavaScript is an "object-oriented" language?
       * JavaScript is uses objects for data storage and manipulation.
       * JavaScript objects enforce a directional flow of data. Their orientation tells us whether the data flows up or down.
       * JavaScript is modeled on a Java object, and provides a browser-level scripting language to interact with that Java object.
       * <b>JavaScript is modeled around objects with properties and methods which can be handled in a modular fashion.</b>
     * Question 2 of 7: What happens to the website and the code when you write code in the browser console?
       * When you write code in the console, that code only exists in the console. It doesn't do anything to the website or the window.
       * The console allows you to write code to your project directly in the browser. The code is automatically added to your JavaScript file in your project.
       * <b>Code in the browser console impacts the current browser instance only. It exists in the console for as long as the window is open.</b>
       * Code in the browser console impacts the website and is saved to the original files automatically. Once saved, you can recall the code in the console at any time.
     * Question 3 of 7: What is an indicator of someone being a good JavaScript developer?
       * <b>They follow standards, invest in learning, use formatting and linting tools for consistency, and write accessible code.</b>
       * They use only tabs for indentation.
       * They use only single quotes for strings.
       * They are a React expert and write only ES6.
     * Question 4 of 7: What is the natural environment for JavaScript?
       * <b>The browser, server environments, and your computer.</b>
       * The browser.
       * The code editor.
       * Server environments.
     * Question 5 of 7: What is ECMAScript?
       * A variant of JavaScript used by advanced developers.
       * <b>The specification describing how browsers should implement and interpret JavaScript.</b>
       * A specification describing the JavaScript programming language and how developers use it.
       * A modern version of JavaScript used by React developers.
     * Question 6 of 7: Where should you develop and test your JavaScript code?
       * Develop in a code editor, test in your primary browser.
       * Develop in the browser, test in the same browser.
       * <b>Develop in a code editor, test in as many browsers as you can get your hands on.</b>
       * Develop in command line tools like the browser console, test on a different computer.
     * Question 7 of 7: Why have command line and automation tools become popular in JavaScript development?
       * <b>They simplify complex processes and introduce features to help developers write better code.</b>
       * They add complexity to the development setup to ensure only real JavaScript developers are able to do the work and that amateurs give up.
       * They help developers write better code by transforming the code for browser optimization.
       * They make developers look like hackers from movies and are great for showing off.
2. Up and Running with JS <a name="2"></a>
  *Quiz
    * Question 1 of 4: When does the browser execute JavaScript?
      * By default: When the script is encountered. If the script is set to "async", asynchronously as the HTML page loads. If the script is set to "defer", when all other script is executed.
      * <b>By default: When the script is encountered. If the script is set to "async", when the script is fully loaded. If the script is set to "defer", when the entire HTML page is rendered.</b>
      * By default: After the HTML page is rendered. If the script is set to "async", asynchronously while the HTML page is rendered. If the script is set to "defer", when the user performs an action.
      * Always when the script is encountered. The difference between "async" and "defer" is in what order the scripts are executed.
    * Question 2 of 4: What is the correct markup for adding an external JavaScript file to an HTML document?
      * <b> <script src="javascript.js" async></script> </b>
      * <script src="javascript.js" async="true"></script>
      * <script type="text/javascript">javascript.js</script>
      * <script src="javascript.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    * Question 3 of 4: What happens when you defer JavaScript?
      * The browser loads and executes the JavaScript after all HTML is rendered.
      * <b>The browser loads the JavaScript asynchronously when it is encountered, then waits until all HTML is rendered before executing the script.</b>
      * The browser loads the JavaScript asynchronously when it is encountered, then executes it when it is fully loaded.
      * The browser defers loading of the JavaScript until a function tells it to load and execute it.
    * Question 4 of 4: JavaScript modules are heavily used in frameworks like React and Vue. What is the advantage of using modules?
      * <b>Modules enable modularization of code where individual functions, components, data objects, and other parts can be separated into individual files.</b>
      * Modules are required for modern JavaScript frameworks to work properly.
      * Modules allow developers to split code into multiple files for easier sharing and maintenance.
      * Modules enable modern loading of JavaScript to improve performance.
